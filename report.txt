Q3. 
From Q1, we know that it is impossible to color the nodes with three
colors such that all adjacent nodes has different color because the
CNF is not satisfiable. From Q2, we know that there is some way to
color the nodes with four colors such that all adjacent nodes has
different color because the CNF is satisfiable.

Assume we have four colors: green, red, yellow, blue. Then:
1 - green
2 - yellow
3 - blue
4 - green
5 - red
6 - yellow
7 - red


Q4.

From the following generated CNF, we see that the minimum number of colors required
to properly color the graph is 8.
